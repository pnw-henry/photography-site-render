# HENRY ESCOBAR STUDIO
https://henryescobar.studio/

This is the code repository for https://henryescobar.studio/, my personal website showcasing photography and current development projects. It was built using the React framework, leveraging AWS S3 to render images to visitors, and CSS techniques to provide a clean and responsive UX experience. As a photographer, I wanted a centralized location to display all my photos in a simple yet elegant way, so I created this website from scratch to move that vision forward.

## USAGE

The website is divided into three main sections: Photo, Code, and About. Photo holds all my photos, primarily placed into two categories: Outdoors and Lifestyle. Visitors can click on the filtering option in the navigation bar at the bottom to choose the category. Code has (and will have) a little preview and link to some of the apps I'm working on. Finally, About simply tells you a little about me.

## ROADMAP

A few of the things coming...

1. In photo, the ability to sort photos by recent, date taken or popularity.
2. In photo, rendering a lower resolution photo until the full quality version is available.
3. In code, adding more information to each app, such as features currently in the works.
4. Long stretch goal: A point of purchase system, giving visitors the ability to buy prints.
